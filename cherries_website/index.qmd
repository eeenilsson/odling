## Varför plantera flera sorter?

Some are suitable for cooking and others best eaten straight off the tree. Secondly, growing multiple varieties allows you to ensure a steady supply of cherries throughout the warmer months.  Thirdly,  you can never know how well a  particular variety will do in your garden, so it is always worth experimenting. Lastly, some varieties are resistant to cracking, which usually occurs during summer rains.
